# Stock_market_analysis
using python coding, I have done a stock market analysis for 4 major Tech stocks-( Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft). Analysis included the correlation between the stocks of the companies , value at risk for the amount invested each stock. Used Monte Carlo technique to get the value at risk for Google.
